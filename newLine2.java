    /*  Create a method name as newLine that should have print statement inside the method body as "newLine method implementation"

1. Create a method name as displayLine that should have print statement inside the method body as "displayLine method implementation"

3. Call both methods

**Expected Output:**

```
newLine method implementation
displayLine method implementation   */

void newline(){
    System.out.println("newLine method implementation");
}
void displayLine(){
    System.out.println("displayLine method implementation");
